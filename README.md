# CHEME5440_PS4

All work is submitted in handwritten copy. This repository only has the excel file for Question 1A (CHEME5440HW#4.xlsx) and the code used to plot in Question 4. Simply run CHEME5440HW4.m that calls the function funsys.m to plot activity as a function of time for ligand values modified in the funsys.m file (defaulted to 1).
